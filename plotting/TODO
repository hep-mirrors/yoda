PLotting thoughts and TODOs
===========================

Booleans should be specifiable via integers (0=false,1=true), true/false,
   yes/no, on/off -- string comparisons being case-insensitive

Show ratio unless no plot has a RatioRef=yes

Prefer specifying plot properties, e.g. plot, ratio and legend inclusion, at
histo level rather than in the PLOT section.

Alpha level in color spec -- automatic?

How to specify a fill-between band?
