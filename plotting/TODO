Plotting thoughts and TODOs
===========================

DESIGN
------

* Booleans should be specifiable via integers
   (0=false,1=true), true/false, yes/no, on/off -- string comparisons being
   case-insensitive. Done in as_bool(x) in yodaplot, should go into yoda.plot or
   yoda.util.

* Prefer specifying plot properties at histo level rather than in the PLOT section.
   e.g. plot, ratio and legend inclusion

* How to allow full customisation?
   For people who want to add arrows, general annotations, v/hlines, shaded
   areas... just make it as easy as possible for them to write their own
   plotting script, or allow code insertion in .dat?


TASKS
-----

* PLOT section parsing
   By separate parsing of data file in Python function -- use same function for
   .plot file reading?)

* Lin/log axis control for main (and ratio) plots
   Controlled from PLOT section

* 2D plotting

* Split into more reusable function / object bits for scripted customisation

* Provide a yodacmp to contain most of the comparison logic
   N runs * M obs -> N lines in M plot files. rivet-cmphistos can then be a thin
   wrapper on this (or the constituent YODA package functions) to add
   Rivet-specific logic like special handling of /REF and /TMP path prefixes.

* How to specify a fill-between band in .dat files?
   Should have a "band" plotting style -- and break out the code to assemble the
   correct arrays, call the right plotting command, etc. into functions for easy
   reuse.


MINOR
-----

* Alpha level in color spec -- automatic?
   Test with current code

* Font control
   Needs to be specified within font family. Use a single key like
   serif/Palatino? (A colon family/font separator won't work because we use
   colons to separate keys on the cmphistos command line.)

* Old-style figures
   Via fontspec package keys? Requires MPL modifications?
