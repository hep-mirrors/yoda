	* Python SWIG interface now compiles and can be used: the subtlety
	that was breaking it was that SWIG has to be prodded in pretty
	non-obvious ways to make std::vectors of classes without
	default (no-arg) constructors. See
	http://osdir.com/ml/programming.swig/2004-04/msg00011.html for
	about the only reference to this to be found anywhere!

	* Basic AIDA writer now available - it doesn't yet output all the
	necessary information though, especially not for merging parallel
	runs.
