	* Adding indexed set for holding bins on axes. Still not sure it's
	what we want, as (I just realised) STL sets are iterator-immutable
	because they are self-keyed and changes to elements would also
	change their sorting.

	* Restarting ChangeLog contributions! Many changes in the huge
	time since last update... activity on YODA has renewed and we have
	a better picture of the distinctive features we require. New idea:
	named weight vector filling, allowing "parallel" histograms for
	various event weight variations. I/O remains an awkward issue,
	especially since the classes are now much richer than they used to
	be, and don't know about paths. Output can be easily put on top:
	not an issue... and we can probably do something with
	pickling. But reading in from C++?

	* Moved duplicate Histo1D/Profile1D code on to Axis, making Axis a
	templated class at the same time.

	* Started work on a little plotting tool, initially for Herwig++
	parton pT cut testing, but incrementally enhancing it to be a
	command-line quick plotter seems like a good idea.

	* Added some more test programs... working towards a proper test
	suite.

	* Added "no path & title" constructors - you don't always want to
	write out the histo, since sometimes it's just a good way to
	gather statistics.

	* Fixed YODA mapping to allow use of vectors of bins as Python
	lists.

	* Added Profile1D functionality.

	* Fixed Dbn1D to use sign(weight) as part of the "w**2" measure,
	so that negative weights behave themselves.

	* Added Dbn1D class to centralise the calculation of statistics
	from unbounded, unbinned, weighted distributions.

	* Added Profile1D class.

	* Fixed NaN errors from zero weights.

	* Python SWIG interface now compiles and can be used: the subtlety
	that was breaking it was that SWIG has to be prodded in pretty
	non-obvious ways to make std::vectors of classes without
	default (no-arg) constructors. See
	http://osdir.com/ml/programming.swig/2004-04/msg00011.html for
	about the only reference to this to be found anywhere!

	* Basic AIDA writer now available - it doesn't yet output all the
	necessary information though, especially not for merging parallel
	runs.
