	* Moved duplicate Histo1D/Profile1D code on to Axis, making Axis a
	templated class at the same time.

	* Started work on a little plotting tool, initially for Herwig++
	parton pT cut testing, but incrementally enhancing it to be a
	command-line quick plotter seems like a good idea.

	* Added some more test programs... working towards a proper test
	suite.

	* Added "no path & title" constructors - you don't always want to
	write out the histo, since sometimes it's just a good way to
	gather statistics.

	* Fixed YODA mapping to allow use of vectors of bins as Python
	lists.

	* Added Profile1D functionality.

	* Fixed Dbn1D to use sign(weight) as part of the "w**2" measure,
	so that negative weights behave themselves.

	* Added Dbn1D class to centralise the calculation of statistics
	from unbounded, unbinned, weighted distributions.

	* Added Profile1D class.

	* Fixed NaN errors from zero weights.

	* Python SWIG interface now compiles and can be used: the subtlety
	that was breaking it was that SWIG has to be prodded in pretty
	non-obvious ways to make std::vectors of classes without
	default (no-arg) constructors. See
	http://osdir.com/ml/programming.swig/2004-04/msg00011.html for
	about the only reference to this to be found anywhere!

	* Basic AIDA writer now available - it doesn't yet output all the
	necessary information though, especially not for merging parallel
	runs.
