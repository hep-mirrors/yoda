YODA TODO list
==============

NOW

* Add extra constructors and path/title handling to Profile1D Python interface (AB)

* Axis2D needs a complete rewrite. (AB)
  Additionally: Fix order in which points are specified in the
  Bin2D constructor. Add a merge() method in Bin2D. Add a constructor
  that takes Dbns.

* Add copy assignment to Point/Scatter3D and Dbn1D/2D. (AB)

* Rebinning: global rebinning of Axis2D -> Histo2D by integer factor(s) --
  different factors in x and y directions.

* Improve tests Makefile setup to work out the path to the Python build dir. (AB)

* Make the first Python test actually test something in YODA! (AB)

* Test that a y-binned Histo2D has the same per-y-column stats as an
  equivalently x-binned Profile1D. Perhaps use this as an opportunity to
  implement one of the the conversion functions mentioned in the NEXT
  section...

* Test negative- and mixed-weighted stat calculations, and scaling.

* Test gap handling on 1D and 2D axes.

* Add Histo2D binning constructors from Scatter3D and Profile2D.

* Add Scatter1D/Point1D (AB)

* Transform 1D differential to integral histos and vice versa.
  Bins have to be contiguous. (AB)



NEXT

* Add a Counter type (mostly a UI/persistency wrapper on Dbn1D) (AB)

* Multiple errors on Scatter2D -- via a vector of Error2D? How to implement
  flexible error combination? Error correlations?

* WriterFlat and ReaderFlat, for Scatter2D representations only. (HH)

* Arbitrary function transforms on Scatters (AB)



AND AFTER THAT...

* Scatter2D -> Scatter<N> again (?) with specialisations for 1D, 2D and 3D

* Terminal histos via WriterAsciiArt

* Write scripts to convert between data formats and to plot results.

* Template all classes on floating point type (default to double)

* Look into pickling of C++ interfaced classes. WriterS10n? MessagePack? Protobuf?
  The latter two look awesome...
