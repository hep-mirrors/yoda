YODA TODO list
==============

* Store enough information for datafile merging to be well defined, with
  appropriate statistical combinations for each data type.
* Explicitly return NaN for profile histo points with no weight.
* Write scripts to convert between data formats and to plot results.
* Add math utility functions like isZero(double, tolerance=1E-5), 
  areEqual(double, double, fractolerance=1E-5), ...

Data line definition:
H1D: xl xh y dy w w2 n wx wx2 (dysys,...)
P1D: xl xh y dy w w2 n wx wx2 wy wy2 (dysys,...)?
Define integration with Hendrik's flat format:
"#" marks for comments: gnuplot compatibility
Metadata as special comments
Suggesting logx, logy, etc.?

* Incorporate/extend Hendrik's make_plot script
