YODA TODO list
==============

* Deal with integral vs. differential histos
   Only use diff but represent as / convert to int?

* Get height measure "right" for log binning
   Really? Or ditch "height"?

* Store enough information for datafile merging to be well defined, with
  appropriate statistical combinations for each data type.

* Explicitly return NaN for profile histo points with no weight.

* Write scripts to convert between data formats and to plot results.

* Add math utility functions like isZero(double, tolerance=1E-5), 
  areEqual(double, double, fractolerance=1E-5), ...

* Store "norm" and "scale" as members (and write out in histo header), rather
   than convert type or scale internally. API for this?

Data line definition:
H1D: xl xh y dy w w2 n wx wx2 (dysys,...)
P1D: xl xh y dy w w2 n wx wx2 wy wy2 (dysys,...)?
Define integration with Hendrik's flat format:
"#" marks for comments: gnuplot compatibility
Metadata as special comments
Suggesting logx, logy, etc.?

* Incorporate/extend Hendrik's make_plot script

* Think about providing an interface for integral distributions

* Consider "X/Y" naming scheme for Profile1D... if we extend to 2D histos, then
   "Y" is inappropriate and we should probably use something else to be
   future-proof.

* Does Writer hierarchy make sense? Yes, for plugins...

* Output header and footer

* Sort out collection iterator args (needs templates)

* Move writer iteration and collection stuff into Writer, leaving WriterYODA 
   and WriterAIDA to just implement the actual format writing parts.

* Rename AnalysisObject -> Plotable?
