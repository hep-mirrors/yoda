YODA TODO list
==============

* Store enough information for datafile merging to be well defined, with
  appropriate statistical combinations for each data type.
* Explicitly return NaN for profile histo points with no weight.
* Write out to special data format or extend AIDA?
* Write scripts to convert between data formats and to plot results.
